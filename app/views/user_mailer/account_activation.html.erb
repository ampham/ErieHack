<h1>Sample App</h1>

<!-- As with any view, we can user ERB with instance variables we've defined.
Here, the instance variable @user is defined in the user_mailer mailer -->
<p>Hi <%= @user.name %>,</p>

Welcome to the Sample App! Click on the link below to activate your account:
</p>

<!-- The following code corresponds to the edit path of the account_activations
resource. In the same way that edit_user_url(user) will produce the URL 

http://www.example.com/users/1/edit 

this account activation link will produce the URL

http://www.example.com/account_activations/q5lt38hQDc_959PVoo6b7A/edit?email=foo%40example.com

where the random string is the activation token (a URL-safe base64 string 
generated by the new_token method in the user model) and the email address of 
the user is the key-value pair following the ? sign in the URL, in this case
'email: foo@example.com' - this is called a QUERY PARAMETER -->
<%= link_to "Activate", edit_account_activation_url(@user.activation_token,
                                                    email: @user.email) %>
