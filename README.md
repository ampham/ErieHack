# WaterWatcher

This is a project for 
[*Erie Hack*](http://eriehack.io/) competition in cooperation with
[*Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper*](http://bnriverkeeper.org/).

The goal is to create a text messaging service to allow residents of Western New York
to access data about drinking water quality as well as the health of the region's streams, rivers and waterways. Waterwatcher implements [*Plivo*](https://www.plivo.com/) and [*TextIt*](https://www.textit.in/), which are awesome SMS-to-HTTP services.
