# Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper Datacenter

This is a project for the Buffalo
[*Erie Hack*](http://eriehack.io/) competition in cooperation with
[*Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper*](http://bnriverkeeper.org/).

The goal is to create a web application and API to allow residents of Western New York
to access Riverkeeper's data in real time via this website and through text messages 
by implementing [*Plivo*](https://www.plivo.com/), an SMS-to-HTTP service.
