the user is the key-value pair following the ? sign in the URL, in this case
'email: foo@example.com' - this is called a QUERY PARAMETER -->

<!-- The following code corresponds to the edit path of the account_activations
resource. In the same way that edit_user_url(user) will produce the URL

this account activation link will produce the URL

http://www.example.com/account_activations/q5lt38hQDc_959PVoo6b7A/edit?email=foo%40example.com

where the random string is the activation token (a URL-safe base64 string 
generated by the new_token method in the user model) and the email address of 
the user is the key-value pair following the ? sign in the URL, in this case
'email: foo@example.com' - this is called a QUERY PARAMETER -->

<!-- The following code corresponds to the edit path of the account_activations
resource. In the same way that edit_user_url(user) will produce the URL 

http://www.example.com/users/1/edit 

this account activation link will produce the URL

http://www.example.com/account_activations/q5lt38hQDc_959PVoo6b7A/edit?email=foo%40example.com

where the random string is the activation token (a URL-safe base64 string 
generated by the new_token method in the user model) and the email address of 
the user is the key-value pair following the ? sign in the URL, in this case
'email: foo@example.com' - this is called a QUERY PARAMETER -->
